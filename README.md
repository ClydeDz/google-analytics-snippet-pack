Google Analytics Snippet Pack for Visual Studio helps you write global site tag (gtag.js) code that allows you to send event data to Google Analytics. Due to the nature of this extension, you will find these snippets in HTML and JavaScript Google Analytics Snippet Pack is compatible right from Visual Studio 2012 to 2017 (Community, Professional and Enterprise).

## How to use?

The Google Analytics Snippet Pack extends the code snippet manager of Visual Studio and allows you to insert code snippets into your editor. To insert snippets for the language you're currently writing in your editor, you can use the shortcut keys ``CTRL+K CTRL+X`` and then find Fancy Comments as a folder. Alternatively, to bring up the code snippet manager, use the shortcut keys ``CTRL+K CTRL+B``. The GIF below shows HTML Google Analytics Snippet Pack being used.

## Feedback

Google Analytics Snippet Pack is just in version 1.0.0 right now. Should you find your use case missing in the snippet pack, it would be great if you could create a new issue on [GitHub here](https://github.com/ClydeDz/google-analytics-snippet-pack/issues) and let me know what you're after and I can include that in the product backlog for next releases. Please search the issues first before creating a new one.
